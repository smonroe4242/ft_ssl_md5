# ft_ssl_md5
My implementation of OpenSSL in C99 standard within the Norminette code style guidelines for 42 Silicon Valley.
* Run make to compile ft_ssl executable
* ./ft_ssl ( md5 | sha256 ) [-p to read from stdin] [-qr quiete/reverse output] [-s "string to be hashed"] (filenames ...)
* Flag handling using personal implementation of getopt, handles identical to openssl executable sans some quips I had with the -p and -s mechanics therein
